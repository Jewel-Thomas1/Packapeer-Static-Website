                                                        It is easy to lose interest in studies as you dislike certain
                                                        subject.
                                                        So how will you develop an interest in your subject?
                                                        When you find a way to enjoy what you are doing, you will be
                                                        more motivated to do well in your life and
                                                        might even have fun doing it. If you feel bored with the usual
                                                        university system of scoring marks,
                                                        remember that you may not always have to do things in the same
                                                        way. A little variety will keep things
                                                        interesting. So here is Packapeer, we help you to create an
                                                        internal love to the subject. We help you
                                                        learn the fundamentals of computer and get insight in to basic
                                                        technologies. You know what you are
                                                        capable of. You know what you can do and what you cannot.
                                                        Sometimes the lack of your interest in studies
                                                        will be because you are not sure of why a subject is important
                                                        or relevant in real life. We help you
                                                        understand some of fun and interesting ways that subject can be
                                                        relevant. We help you build your
                                                        capability in self study.

                                                        Do you feel strange to learn programming language without a
                                                        Computer Science degree?
                                                        Is it true that programming is not for everyone?
                                                        If you think so, you are wrong.
                                                        Programming is a simple rules for instructing computing devices.
                                                        We here in Packapeer prove that
                                                        programming is for everyone, anyone who knows basic mathematical
                                                        knowledge, anyone who can read and
                                                        write English language.
                                                        For that here we use C programming as the first step to the
                                                        world of programming. C programming is a
                                                        basic language. You can combine it with every other language.
                                                        Learning C programming makes you to learn
                                                        any other language much easier. Here we do not encourage boring
                                                        theory sessions for studying C
                                                        programming. We use practical workshop examples so you can learn
                                                        to “do” things easily. We help you
                                                        build the real output. We encourage studying through “doing”
                                                        rather than just reading to score marks or
                                                        to pass exams. And we will help you through the concepts, by our
                                                        own simple and fun ways of teaching.

                                                        It seems like a simple question but still most fails to answer
                                                        it as our universities does not teach all
